# Currency Converter

This is a simple Currency Converter application built using React.js and Axios. It fetches real-time exchange rates from an external API to allow users to convert between various currencies.

## Features
- **Currency Selection**: Users can select the source and target currencies from a dropdown list.
- **Amount Input**: Users can input an amount to be converted.
- **Conversion**: The app fetches the exchange rate and converts the amount from the source currency to the target currency.
- **Real-time Rates**: The application dynamically fetches exchange rates using the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when there are issues fetching data.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter.git
cd currency-converter
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start the app
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React development server and open the application in your default browser.

Environment Variables
The app uses the ExchangeRate-API for fetching exchange rates. You can replace the API_KEY in the code with your own API key for production usage.

js
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
Usage
Enter an amount you wish to convert.
Select the source currency from the first dropdown.
Select the target currency from the second dropdown.
Click "Convert" to see the converted amount.
If an error occurs (e.g., when fetching data), an error message will be shown.
Troubleshooting
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection as the application relies on fetching real-time data from an external API.
If the dropdowns do not load, check that the API is returning data correctly (you can log the response in the fetchCurrencies function).
